auto sufficiency {#auto-sufficiency}
: Auto sufficiency is achieved when the number of vehicles available to a household is equal to or greater than the number of licensed drivers in a household. A household in "auto insufficient" when that is not true. Zero-auto households are cases where the household has access to a vehicle.
