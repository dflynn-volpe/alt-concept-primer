age group {#age-group}
: VisionEval uses the same age groups used in the U.S. Census: 0-14, 15-19, 20-29, 30-54, 55-64, and 65+ years old. The number of persons in each age group are defined for each synthetic household.

auto operating cost

auto ownership costs

auto sufficiency {#auto-sufficiency}
: Auto sufficiency is achieved when the number of vehicles available to a household is equal to or greater than the number of licensed drivers in a household. A household in "auto insufficient" when that is not true. Zero-auto households are cases where the household has access to a vehicle. In the age of ubiquitous mobility services this definition may become less important in describing mobility options open to the household.

lifecycle {#lifecycle}
: A label used to describe the stage of life that a household's members are at. This is guessed at in VisionEval as a function of the number of adults, children, and workers in the household. This is assigned in the `AssignLifeCycle` module. It assumes one of 10 values defined in the [2009 NHTS LIF_CYC variable](https://nhts.ornl.gov/tables09/CodebookPage.aspx?id=1239)

location type {#location-type}
: Each household is classified by whether its enclosing Bzone is located in an urban, town, or rural area. The `location_type` variable is defined for each Bzone.
